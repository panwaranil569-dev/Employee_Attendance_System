    "\n",
    "This project is a simple **Employee Attendance System in Python**.  \n",
    "It allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add Employees  \n",
    "- Mark Attendance  \n",
    "- View Attendance Records  \n",
    "- Generate Attendance Report  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Methodology\n",
    "1. Used **Python Class** to create Employee Attendance System.  \n",
    "2. Stored employee data in a **Dictionary**.  \n",
    "3. Implemented functions for `add_employee`, `mark_attendance`, and `view_report`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Challenges\n",
    "- Avoiding duplicate attendance entries for the same day.  \n",
    "- Managing employees not yet added to the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "This Employee Attendance System helps track employees efficiently.  \n",
    "It can be extended with **database integration** for real-world use.\n"
